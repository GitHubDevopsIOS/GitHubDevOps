# GitHubDevOps
This is a SwiftUI App that measures CI/CD metrics connecting to the GitHub GraphQL API


Steps to get going:</br>
1) Create GitHub OAuth Application
    Application Name: You choose
    Homepage URL: you choose, not really used
    Applicaiton description: you choose
    Callback URL. something like app://auth
2) Clone GitHubDevOps</br>
3) Update PropertyFiles\keys.plist to include YOUR GitHub Client_ID, Secret, & Callback.  You can ignore github token(I used this for testing the Bearer token)</br>
4) Let me know any issues with this process</br>
