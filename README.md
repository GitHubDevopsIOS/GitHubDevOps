# GitHubDevOps
This is a SwiftUI App that measures CI/CD metrics connecting to the GitHub GraphQL API


Steps to get going
1) Create GitHub Token with the following scopes:
    user
    public_repo
    repo
    repo_deployment
    repo:status
    read:repo_hook
    read:org
    read:public_key
    read:gpg_key
2) Clone GitHubDevOps
3) Update PropertyFiles\keys.plist to include YOUR GitHub Token
4) Let me know any issues with this process
